# Deterministic TAE rule configurations

`tae_rules_production_v1.yaml` is the frozen deterministic production preset.
The canonical sorter loads it automatically under its default rules method:

```bash
python scripts/sort_shot_mixed.py \
  --method rules \
  --shot_dir /path/to/SHOT \
  --out_dir /path/to/output
```

The rule engine still returns REVIEW/`NO_GOOD_TEMPLATE` for a mode that passes
all gates. The production orchestrator records the separate
`accept-as-good-v1` policy that promotes such survivors to final GOOD before
manual overrides and optional duplicate ranking. This workflow policy is not
part of the frozen rule configuration and does not change its bytes or
SHA-256.

For a conservative audit of this exact preset without survivor promotion, run:

```bash
python scripts/sort_shot_rules.py \
  --shot_dir /path/to/SHOT \
  --out_dir /path/to/audit-output \
  --rule_config tae_rules_production_v1
```

Use `sort_shot_rules.py` without `--rule_config` for threshold calibration and
feature-only experiments.

Configuration files use strict JSON-compatible YAML so the production sorter
can load them with the Python standard library. The loader validates exact
keys, numerical constraints, the pinned rule-engine version, and the frozen
production SHA-256.

Do not edit a frozen production configuration. Add a newly named version for
any future gate, threshold, routing, or ruleset change. Any interface loading a
named configuration rejects config-owned threshold and gate overrides.
